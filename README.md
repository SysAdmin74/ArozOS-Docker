# ArozOS-Docker

This is [ArozOS](https://github.com/tobychui/arozos) with docker support.
I am also newbies to docker, so this is first time making it.
I will be restarting this project and keep it updated with the official ArozOS (I said it 3 year ago lol, Yes this time is real)

## For your infomation, currently in beta
Please don't use it in actual production environment, if you have awesome ideas feel free to share.

## Todo List
- Docker Environment variable support. \[Some variable\]
- Maybe Prebuild Image? \[Coming Soon\]

## Run it with docker compose 
Check docker-compose.yaml before you run. Change the data paths inside the yaml to your path.
```
docker-compose up
```
### Requirement..
Make sure you have docker-compose installed.

### Networking
By default HTTP (8980) port will be open, if you need others you can modify the yaml file.
