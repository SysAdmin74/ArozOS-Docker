# ArozOS-Docker# ArozOS-Docker
This is [ArozOS](https://github.com/tobychui/arozos) with docker support.
I am also newbies to docker, so this is first time making it.

## Run it with docker compose
```
docker-compose up
```
### Requirement..
Make sure you have docker-compose installed. In case you can't do things with docker-compose.yaml file.

### Networking
By default HTTP (8980) and FTP (8921) port will be open, if you need others you can modify the yaml file.
